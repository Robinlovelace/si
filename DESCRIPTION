Description: Develop spatial interaction models (SIMs).  SIMs predict the
    amount of interactions, for example number of trips per day, between
    geographic entities representing trip origins and destinations.  SIMs
    can be unconstrained, production-constrained, attraction-constrained
    and doubly-constrained (Wilson 1979) <doi:10.1068/a030001>.  The
    package contains functions for unconstrained and doubly-constrained
    SIMs.
