The goal of {si} is to demonstrate Spatial Interaction models from first principles (see the `sims` vignette for a more detailed description of SIMs and implementation in R without using this package for reference).
The package also contains reproducible code and documentation demonstrating how they work.

Spatial Interaction Models (SIMs) estimate movement between spatial entities.
They have been central to transport modelling since the 1960s, with many refinements over the [decades](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284345182_Forecasting_urban_travel_Past_present_and_future).
There are four main [types](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2015.12.008) of traditional SIM:

-   Unconstrained

-   Production-constrained

-   Attraction-constrained

-   Doubly-constrained

The focus of this package is currently on unconstrained and production-constrained SIMs.

# Implementations in other languages

We would be interested to hear how the approach presented in this package compared with other implementations such as those presented in the links below.
If anyone would like to try the approach or implement it in another language feel free to get in touch via the issue tracker.
